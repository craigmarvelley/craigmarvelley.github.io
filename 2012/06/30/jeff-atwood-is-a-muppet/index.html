<div class="entry-content"><p>I was having a nice, relaxing Saturday morning until I read through my Twitter timeline and was directed to Jeff Atwood&#8217;s latest post on Coding Horror, &#8220;<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/06/the-php-singularity.html">The PHP Singularity</a>&#8220;. After reading through it, and the comments from other readers, I got annoyed. Really annoyed.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t repeat the article, but the gist of it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>PHP is a horrible language</li>
<li>Something must be done</li>
<li>Jeff is the person to do it</li>
</ul>


<p>I quite enjoy blogging but I don&#8217;t do it very often. I try to make sure anything I talk about is well researched, because a baseless opinion is worthless, but I don&#8217;t have a lot of free time &#8211; so if I don&#8217;t have something I consider worth saying, I don&#8217;t say it.</p>

<p>Jeff doesn&#8217;t have the same concern. You may wonder why I read his blog, given that I clearly take exception to some of its content, but the funny thing is that when talking about things he is knowledgable of, he has some great advice.</p>

<p>Like when he talks about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/on-parenthood.html">his children</a>, because he obviously knows them, or <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/06/because-everyone-still-needs-a-router.html">routers</a>, where he&#8217;s clearly done some investigation. Now, I&#8217;m about to become a father, so I really enjoyed the former post, and if I needed to buy a router, I&#8217;d probably just be lazy and pick one from the latter because he knows a lot more about them than I do.</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s the thing. Jeff doesn&#8217;t seem to know much about PHP. I&#8217;d guess he&#8217;s read some posts about it, seen a few Q&amp;As on Stack Overflow about it (a site he deserves massive kudos for), read through the PHP Manual, whatever &#8211; but he&#8217;s not a PHP developer. When he says PHP is &#8216;terrible&#8217; or &#8216;deeply flawed&#8217;, I wonder how he&#8217;s come to that conclusion? Has he ever developed anything substantial in PHP? What is he basing this opinion on? He&#8217;s played with his children, he&#8217;s bought and installed a router. But when it comes to PHP, is the extent of his knowledge that which he has gleaned from others? Because if that&#8217;s the case, he really should think twice about offering his opinion on it.</p>

<p>The most glaring statement in the entire article is this one:</p>

<blockquote><p>Therefore, I&#8217;d like to submit a humble suggestion to my fellow programmers. The next time you feel the urge to write Yet Another Epic Critique of PHP, consider that:</p>

<ol>
<li>We get it already. PHP is horrible, but it&#8217;s used everywhere. Guess what? It was just as horrible in 2008. And 2005. And 2002. There&#8217;s a pattern here, but it&#8217;s subtle. You have to look very closely to see it. On second thought, never mind. You&#8217;re probably not smart enough to figure it out.</li>
<li>The best way to combat something as pervasively and institutionally awful as PHP is not to point out all its (many, many, <em>many</em>) faults, but to <strong>build compelling alternatives</strong> and <strong>make sure these alternatives are equally pervasive, as easy to set up and use as possible</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>How anyone can offer a &#8216;humble&#8217; suggestion and then go on to question the reader&#8217;s intelligence is besides the point (though it does nicely illustrate Jeff&#8217;s technique of drawing the reader in with deference only to hit them with a massive dose of self-righteousness) &#8211; but there&#8217;s two things I really take exception to here. Firstly, as <strong>anyone</strong> who has spent any real time with PHP knows, the language is far, far different now to what it was in 2002. For heaven&#8217;s sake, PHP5 (with a brand new object model that made proper OOP possible) didn&#8217;t make its debut &#8217;til 2004, and support for register_globals (one of the worst features of PHP, ever) was removed in the most recent version, 5.4. Those facts are available under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP&#8217;s entry on Wikipedia</a>, but perhaps Jeff&#8217;s not smart enough to Google the history of PHP before commenting on it?</p>

<p>Secondly; assuming for a second that PHP is as horrible as he deems it to be &#8211; the best way to &#8216;combat&#8217; it isn&#8217;t to &#8216;build compelling alternatives&#8217; and &#8216;make sure these alternatives are equally pervasive, as easy to set up and use as possible&#8217; &#8211; no, the &#8216;best&#8217; thing to do (considering the amount of developers and sites worldwide who depend on the language and are getting things done with it every single day) is <strong>get involved</strong> with and <strong>actually understand</strong> PHP &#8211; read the <a href="http://news.php.net/php.internals">internals mailing list</a>, make <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">requests for comments</a>, code contributions, etc. It&#8217;s a silly person who decides to try something new before attempting to fix what&#8217;s broken, when there is so much invested in it. Perhaps if Jeff wasn&#8217;t trying to drum up interest in this new project of his, he&#8217;d have been a little less inflammatory?</p>

<p>Look, as someone who has used PHP successfully for the last decade, obviously I&#8217;m going to disagree with Jeff&#8217;s opinion. But the language has not only helped me get a great job, a nice house, and will shortly be helping me pay for one of those baby things, it&#8217;s also made Facebook the biggest website in the world, and enabled Yahoo! to build (ok, and throw away, but it&#8217;s not PHP&#8217;s fault) an empire. When Jeff&#8217;s got off his soap box and tried to build something equally successful in PHP <strong>and failed</strong>, I&#8217;ll start taking his opinion seriously.</p>

<p>As I said, I don&#8217;t like making statements unless I&#8217;ve researched them fully. I&#8217;ve read Coding Horror for a long time, and I feel qualified to say that Jeff Atwood is a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=muppet&amp;defid=778738">muppet</a>.</p>
