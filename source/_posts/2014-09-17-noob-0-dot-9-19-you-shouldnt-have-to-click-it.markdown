Gav and myself mainly talk about software company processes and principles, with a little bit on communication tools and AWS thrown in for good measure.

This is the first podcast we've recorded remotely, since Gav moved to Bristol. Following [this Macworld post's directions](http://www.macworld.com/article/2030512/how-we-produce-our-podcasts.html) seemed to work; we each recorded our own audio via Quicktime, and synced it up with our "master" recording from Skype, made possible via [Call Recorder](http://ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/). I sequenced it all in GarageBand, with the odd final edit in Audacity.

We're five episodes in since we rebooted the podcast back in June. There's still a lot of room for improvement (especially, for me, in my speech - I find it hard to speak in a slow cadence, and concentrating on that often distracts me from the topic at hand), but I feel that each episode has gained in professionalism, and they're a lot of fun to do.

Check it out on Soundcloud [here](https://soundcloud.com/never-out-of-beta/you-shouldnt-have-to-click-it), or even [subscribe on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/never-out-of-beta/id908946657?mt=2) thanks to Soundcloud's currently-in-beta integration with that service, which we're fortunate have been given access to.
