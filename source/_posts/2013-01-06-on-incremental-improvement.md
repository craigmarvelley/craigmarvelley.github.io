Twice today I&#8217;ve seen references to the benefits of iterative improvement, and I found that the topic resonated with me. At the moment I&#8217;m halfway though a pretty lengthy software project in which it&#8217;s sometimes hard to see the wood for the trees. The backlog is substantial, resulting in a hefty set of tasks for our team. In these situations, where the to-do list doesn&#8217;t seem to change day to day, it&#8217;s easy to feel crippled by inertia. However, these two references illustrate that we can succeed provided we ensure we&#8217;re making healthy, gradual progress.

One might expect that the references I&#8217;m alluding to originate from a tome of software development, like &#8220;[The Pragmatic Programmer][1]&#8220;, or from one of the many celebrated development gurus of Twitter, but in fact they are not directly concerned with software at all. The first comes from [a talk discussing the pros and cons of iterative improvement][2] , linked to by my colleague (and all-round good chap) [Owen Phelps][3], by Tim Harford at last year&#8217;s Wired UK conference:

> If you put together enough marginal improvements, in enough areas, you get something that&#8217;s truly outstanding.

Give it a watch &#8211; it&#8217;s entertaining and informative.

The second reference came from an altogether different source &#8211; [an interview with renowned mix engineer Alan Moulder][4] in this month&#8217;s issue of Sound on Sound magazine, in which he discusses his approach when applying VST plugins to his music projects:

> All the things I use do something to make the sound a tiny bit better, and if  you add everything together, the end result will be a lot better&#8230; It&#8217;s simple: better is better, whether it&#8217;s a tiny bit better or a lot better.

Through never-ending sprints, features and tasks, iterative improvement is something all development teams should strive to achieve.
