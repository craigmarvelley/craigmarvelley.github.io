I've never really taken the time to read up on how DNS works. Ten years of web development mean I've gradually assumed a pretty good idea through trial and error, but I've never really felt 100% confident that I know what I'm doing when registering and administering domain names, particularly when it comes to more obscure record types like [SPF](http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch9/spf.html). Things work, but I don't _really_ know why.

I was shopping for a domain name the other day and while on the DNSimple website I was invited to receive a series of emails that offered to outline the DNS basics. I batted away my initial reluctance to sign myself up for spam, and I'm glad I did - the lessons are nicely written, short and to the point, and thankfully aren't just an excercise in advertising for the registrar. I've learned a couple things and reinforced my knowledge of others. I can't find a signup link now, but I do recommend them to anyone who wants to learn more about DNS.
