I've always enjoyed reading [microblogs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) like [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/) which briefly editorialise links to content elsewhere on the web - it's like "Here's something interesting, here's some perspective on it, now go read it.". While we've had a blog on the Box UK website for some time, the format of it has been very much long-form. While that means we produce lots of in depth, informative content, the downside is because it can take a while to turn posts around the blog doesn't suit snappy, quick posts in the microblog style. 

Internally, we're always sharing links to posts or videos in [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) - stuff that's relevant to our day-to-day work, stuff that could be useful to us in future, that sort of thing. For a while it's been on our roadmap to introduce a microblog on the [Box UK website](http://www.boxuk.com/), and now we have - last week we lauched the [Box UK developer blog](http://www.boxuk.com/developer-blog/). We've already had posts on varied topics like SSH, Objective-C, Vim and Amazon S3. Keep an eye on it!
