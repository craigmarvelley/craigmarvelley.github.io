I&#8217;ve decided to enter the [PHP on Azure contest][1] that&#8217;s being organised by [PHP Benelux][2] and supported by [Microsoft][3], which is challenging developers to build a PHP application that runs in and takes advantage of the [Windows Azure platform][4], Microsoft&#8217;s recent cloud computing offering.

While I wouldn&#8217;t grumble if I won a trip to Las Vegas for MIX2012 (the first prize), my main motivation for entering is to see how the platform can engender scalability in a web application, since that&#8217;s a subject close to my heart. I&#8217;m also hoping to use it as an excuse to experiment with some cutting-edge libraries and frameworks in PHP like Doctrine 2, and maybe in JavaScript, like ExtJS 4. I&#8217;m thinking the contest rule of regular blogging about my experiences of the Azure platform will help me maintain this blog a little better, too.

So ideally I&#8217;ll be blogging about the contest here, and [tweeting about it][5], until it closes on May 15th.
