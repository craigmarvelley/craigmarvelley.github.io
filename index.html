  <div class="entry-content"><p>The new UISplitViewController class and delegate methods in iOS 8 is interesting, and caused me a lot of head scratching last week.
The problem Brent Simmons describes <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/09/27/uisplitviewcontroller_question">here</a>, where
after rotating the device from regular to compact size class and back again iOS uses the topmost master view controller
as the new detail view, instead of the previous detail view, is roughly the same issue I had.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell so far, I think the following approach solves the issue. Note that I don&rsquo;t think I have the same set up as
Brent - I have a navigation stack in each of the master and detail sides - but I think the general approach
is sound, based on advice from Apple in the the &ldquo;Building Adaptive Apps with UIKit&rdquo; session from this year&rsquo;s WWDC,
and the &ldquo;AdaptivePhotos&rdquo; sample app code they provide.</p>

<p>My UISplitViewController delegate looks like this:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/c3cbbb717c3ef957cbbe.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>#import &quot;UISplitViewControllerDelegateService.h&quot;
#import &quot;NoteViewController.h&quot;

@interface UISplitViewControllerDelegateService () &lt;UISplitViewControllerDelegate&gt;

@end

@implementation UISplitViewControllerDelegateService

- (id)initWithSplitViewController:(UISplitViewController *)controller {
    
    self = [super init];
    if (!self) {
        return nil;
    }
    
    self.splitViewController = controller;
    controller.delegate = self;
    
    return self;
    
}

#pragma mark - Split view

- (BOOL)splitViewController:(UISplitViewController *)splitViewController collapseSecondaryViewController:(UIViewController *)secondaryViewController ontoPrimaryViewController:(UIViewController *)primaryViewController {
    
    if ([secondaryViewController isKindOfClass:[UINavigationController class]]
        &amp;&amp; [[(UINavigationController *)secondaryViewController topViewController] isKindOfClass:[NoteViewController class]]
        &amp;&amp; ([(NoteViewController *)[(UINavigationController *)secondaryViewController topViewController] note] == nil)) {
        // If the detail controller doesn't have an item, display the primary view controller instead
        return YES;
    }

    return NO;
    
}

- (UIViewController *)splitViewController:(UISplitViewController *)splitViewController
separateSecondaryViewControllerFromPrimaryViewController:(UIViewController *)primaryViewController{
    
    if ([primaryViewController isKindOfClass:[UINavigationController class]]) {
        for (UIViewController *controller in [(UINavigationController *)primaryViewController viewControllers]) {
            if ([controller isKindOfClass:[UINavigationController class]] &amp;&amp; [[(UINavigationController *)controller visibleViewController] isKindOfClass:[NoteViewController class]]) {
                return controller;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // No detail view present
    UIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@&quot;Main&quot; bundle:nil];
    UINavigationController *detailView = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@&quot;detailView&quot;];
    
    // Ensure back button is enabled
    UIViewController *controller = [detailView visibleViewController];
    controller.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = self.splitViewController.displayModeButtonItem;
    controller.navigationItem.leftItemsSupplementBackButton = YES;

    return detailView;
    
}

@end
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<ul>
<li>In the &lsquo;collapse&rsquo; method, which is called when the device rotates to portrait, we disregard the detail view controller and use the
master view controller if the detail view has no content</li>
<li>In the &lsquo;merge&rsquo; method, we look to see if there&rsquo;s a navigation controller which is displaying a NoteViewController (this controller
is currently only used as a detail view, exclusively, so it&rsquo;s a safe bet). If it exists, we use it - otherwise we retrieve the &lsquo;stock&rsquo;
note view controller stack from the storyboard and use that.</li>
</ul>


<p>This approach seems to have worked well so far. The majority of issues I&rsquo;ve found have been on the iPhone 6 Plus, which combines the
single hierarchy approach of the smaller form factor devices in regular mode, with the side-by-side dual view approach or the larger form factors
in compact mode - this hybrid strategy seems to require more direction on our part, whereas elsewhere iOS tends to guess right on its own.</p>

<p>A final note - having to manually ensure the back button exists and is configured on the detail view controller is a bit icky, but I needed
to do this to avoid a crash. I&rsquo;d love to hear from anyone with more elegant ways to handle this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gav and myself mainly talk about software company processes and principles, with a little bit on communication tools and AWS thrown in for good measure.</p>

<p>This is the first podcast we&rsquo;ve recorded remotely, since Gav moved to Bristol. Following <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2030512/how-we-produce-our-podcasts.html">this Macworld post&rsquo;s directions</a> seemed to work; we each recorded our own audio via Quicktime, and synced it up with our &ldquo;master&rdquo; recording from Skype, made possible via <a href="http://ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/">Call Recorder</a>. I sequenced it all in GarageBand, with the odd final edit in Audacity.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re five episodes in since we rebooted the podcast back in June. There&rsquo;s still a lot of room for improvement (especially, for me, in my speech - I find it hard to speak in a slow cadence, and concentrating on that often distracts me from the topic at hand), but I feel that each episode has gained in professionalism, and they&rsquo;re a lot of fun to do.</p>

<p>Check it out on Soundcloud <a href="https://soundcloud.com/never-out-of-beta/you-shouldnt-have-to-click-it">here</a>, or even <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/never-out-of-beta/id908946657?mt=2">subscribe on iTunes</a> thanks to Soundcloud&rsquo;s currently-in-beta integration with that service, which we&rsquo;re fortunate to have been given access to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update 2014/09/06</strong> - Michael DeHaan <a href="https://twitter.com/laserllama/status/507325690610728962">mentions on Twitter</a> that he adds in a few seconds of sleep with the pause module to ensure the SSH port is open.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the day provisioning a whole lot of EC2 instances with Ansible from a control machine in the cloud. This involves two stages: firstly an instance is launched, and then once SSH is available (using Ansible&rsquo;s <code>wait_for</code> module), the second stage of more detailed provisioning begins.</p>

<p>An issue I&rsquo;d experienced a few times previously but had not been able to pinpoint, was that often the <code>wait_for</code> module failed to identify that SSH is ready. My Ansible task looked like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- name: Wait until SSH is available
</span><span class='line'>  local_action: 
</span><span class='line'>    module: wait_for 
</span><span class='line'>    host: "{{ item.public_dns_name }}"
</span><span class='line'>    port: 22 
</span><span class='line'>    delay: 60 
</span><span class='line'>    timeout: 320 
</span><span class='line'>    state: started
</span><span class='line'>  with_items: launched_instances.instances</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That task would often time out, but in such cases if I were to immediately try to SSH from the terminal it would succeed, which was odd indeed.</p>

<p>Today this behaviour was consistent, and I eventually realised that in the task I was using the instance&rsquo;s public DNS name, whereas when I was connecting via the terminal I used the public IP address. Indeed, changing the task to use the IP address seems to have made the whole thing a lot more reliable:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- name: Wait until SSH is available
</span><span class='line'>  local_action: 
</span><span class='line'>    module: wait_for 
</span><span class='line'>    host: "{{ item.public_ip }}"
</span><span class='line'>    port: 22 
</span><span class='line'>    delay: 60 
</span><span class='line'>    timeout: 320 
</span><span class='line'>    state: started
</span><span class='line'>  with_items: launched_instances.instances</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that on my Mac (where this was rarely an issue) the DNS cache updates quicker than it does on the control machine in EC2, where this problem was more frequent - using the explicit IP address renders the issue moot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love podcasts. Since I moved house and gained a commute I&rsquo;ve whiled away the time to and from work listening to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, <a href="http://therecord.co">The Record</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/footballweekly">The Guardian&rsquo;s Football Weekly</a>, and a couple of other great shows. Enough that I&rsquo;m barely able to listen to them all. They made me pine for <a href="http://www.neveroutofbeta.com">Never Out Of Beta</a> though, a podcast <a href="https://twitter.com/gavD_UK">Gav</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/handybitesize">Carey</a> started a couple of years ago that I and a few friends would guest on, which was great fun.</p>

<p>But my longing is over - Gav and I have rebooted the show, and the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/never-out-of-beta/episode-0-2-1-its-not-in-my">first episode is available now</a> via Soundcloud!</p>

<p>A couple of notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Production &ldquo;issues&rdquo; (well, I forgot a bunch of audio equipment) meant that we had to record this one via my Macbook&rsquo;s built in microphone. It turned out ok, but we&rsquo;ve got higher standards which hopefully we&rsquo;ll get closer to next time</li>
<li>It took longer than I&rsquo;d have liked to get the episode out because I&rsquo;m learning the ropes when it comes to editing. The WWDC stuff is a bit old hat now, but get past that and I think there&rsquo;s some interesting discussion around the DevOps mindset and provisioning with Ansible</li>
<li>An iTunes feed is coming as soon as I can sort one out - I listen to podcasts through the Apple Podcast app so I&rsquo;m eager to make it available there</li>
<li>Inspired by The Talk Show&rsquo;s recent switch we&rsquo;re hosting the show on SoundCloud, which has been perfect so far</li>
</ul>


<p>As with pretty much everything else Gav and I do, it might take a few iterations before this is something we&rsquo;re really happy with, and feedback to aid us in getting there will be very much appreciated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently re-ran some Ansible provisioning scripts after upgrading the
base box to an Ubuntu 14.04 image and found they stalled midway through. The cause? One
task involved installing the PECL mongo module, and the installation process now prompts
the user to decide whether or not to build with Cyrus SASL support. I couldn&rsquo;t see a way to force
a decision via the PECL installer, and Ansible can&rsquo;t
respond to the prompt, so the provisioning process hung while awaiting an answer.</p>

<p>I found two ways to solve this.</p>

<h2>I&rsquo;ve been expecting you</h2>

<p>I did a bit of Googling and after coming across <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-project/pMy2VWgkQ1s">this post</a>
on the Ansible forum, I took a look at <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/expect">expect</a>. Expect lets you
script interactions with a spawned command, using regex to match against prompt text, and send
appropriate responses. It&rsquo;s a sound approach; I wrote a script that looked like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#!/usr/bin/expect
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>spawn pecl install mongo
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>expect "Build with Cyrus SASL"
</span><span class='line'>send "\r"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>expect eof</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And executed it on the box using Ansible&rsquo;s <code>script</code> module:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- name: Install PECL mongo extension
</span><span class='line'>  script: install_pecl_mongo.expect</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Mission achieved. I felt very pleased with myself for about 30 seconds, which is
how long it took for Paul to wander over and tell me there was a simpler way to do it.
Expect is a really good solution for scripting varied or complex responses, but I wasn&rsquo;t
faced with that problem here&hellip;</p>

<h2>Yes man</h2>

<p>In this specific case, all I wanted to do was answer a prompt which needed a yes or no
answer, and I wasn&rsquo;t concerned which I went with. There&rsquo;s a linux command
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(Unix">yes</a> which &ldquo;outputs an affirmative response,
or a user-defined string of text continuously until killed&rdquo;, which is just what I needed.</p>

<p>So now my task looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- name: Install PECL mongo extension
</span><span class='line'>  shell: yes '' | pecl install mongo</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which continuously pipes the &lsquo;y&rsquo; character (by default) and a newline character into
the install command, automatically causing any prompts to be responded to in the
affirmative. For my simple use case it works perfectly, and is more straightforward than
writing expect scripts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently <a href="http://marvelley.com/blog/2014/03/18/vagrant-1-dot-5-syncing-situation/">mentioned</a>
I&rsquo;m going all-in on provisioning and running all my development
environments in VMs provisioned with Ansible. My Ansible use doesn&rsquo;t end there though -
I&rsquo;m also using it to provision my MacBook.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d read of a few other people doing this - Benjamin Eberlei has a particularly
<a href="http://whitewashing.de/2013/11/19/setting_up_development_machines_ansible_edition.html">good post</a>
on the topic, and was pretty much the inspiration for me doing the
same. Setting up a new machine can be a bit of a bore, and while in theory it
only happens whenever I upgrade hardware I have been caught out in the past with kernel
corruption forcing a reinstall, and I&rsquo;d like
to minimise the hassle should it ever happen again. I have <a href="http://backblaze.com">backups</a>
, but one of the few upsides of going back to scratch with a machine is that it&rsquo;s an
opportunity for spring clean; a script that effectively lists all the essential
components of my computer, and configures them to my taste, makes that so much easier.</p>

<p>Anyway. A couple of people mentioned they&rsquo;d be interested in the playbooks I wrote
to provision my laptop, so I&rsquo;ve taken out anything personal to me and <a href="https://github.com/craigmarvelley/macbook-provisioning">mirrored them
on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Currently the provisioning involves four things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Homebrew and various brews</li>
<li>Install Homebrew Casks and various casks</li>
<li>Enable zsh as default shell and install oh-my-zsh</li>
<li>Install dotfiles to configure git, vim, etc. (my dotfiles repo is <a href="https://github.com/craigmarvelley/dotfiles">here</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>It&rsquo;s all straightforward, but a couple of implementation details:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve ended up using Alfred as my OS X search tool because I store my casks under <code>/usr/local</code>
with the other brew stuff and symlink to /Applications, and Spotlight doesn&rsquo;t
grok symlinks. Instead I configure Alfred to link in the cask files</li>
<li>I read on a few places on the web that the method I use to determine my current shell
process - <code>echo $SHELL</code> - isn&rsquo;t foolproof. Works for me, but YMMV</li>
</ul>


<p>There&rsquo;s more I could do in terms of what I manage, especially when it comes to
dotfile configuration (incidentally one of the best things about automating
provisioning in this way is you end up looking at other people&rsquo;s approaches,
and finding out about libraries and tools that you never even knew existed - <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/rcm-for-rc-files-in-dotfiles-repos">Thoughtbot&rsquo;s rcm</a>
is one such example here).
Also I&rsquo;m still finding my way with Ansible, so my playbooks can undoubtedly be improved, especially
when it comes to idempotency.
Nevertheless I&rsquo;m really happy to have a record of my machine&rsquo;s starting state, and will enjoy adding to it as time
passes.</p>

<p>When starting work at <a href="http://www.bipsync.com">BipSync</a> I resolved to put the bits
and bobs I&rsquo;d learned about provisioning with Vagrant and Ansible into practice, and
no longer host development environments locally on my MacBook. The reasons were
twofold - firstly I wanted my development environment to mirror that
of live as closely as possible, and secondly when previously hosting multiple,
complex projects on one machine I experienced increased battery drain and frequent
slowdowns caused by active background services that I often didn&rsquo;t even need for my current
task. It was a pain to keep track of everything, especially when multiple versions
were required. So the attraction of having dev environments I could bring up and down, and if
necessary occasionally trash, was a strong one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d played with Vagrant / VirtualBox hosted projects on smallish codebases before,
where the default VirtualBox synced folder support was sufficient; however when
attempting to host and develop BipSync&rsquo;s sizeable applications it was quickly clear
that this combination wouldn&rsquo;t be fast enough to be fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Since VirtualBox has been <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/blog/new-vmware-provider-gives-vagrant-a-boost">acknowledged</a>
as the slowest of Vagrant&rsquo;s provider options, and we already had Parallels
licences for the development of our Windows applications, next I tried out the
third party <a href="https://github.com/Parallels/vagrant-parallels">Parallels plugin for Vagrant</a>.
Basically this was a non-starter - I immediately ran into bugs that were present in the project&rsquo;s
issue tracker, and the impression I got was that the plugin is still a work-in-progress.
The plugin is overseen by Parallels so I&rsquo;m optimistic that it&rsquo;ll one day be a
first-class provider, but as it was it was unusable.</p>

<p>So I went back to VirtualBox (VMWare was another option but before forking out money on the
software and accompanying plugin I wanted to exhaust all other options) and tried the other
synced folder types. First I tried the new rsync support, which I&rsquo;d <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-5-rsync.html">read good things
about</a>. In terms of speed this was very quick because there isn&rsquo;t really a share to speak
of; shared items are copied to the guest rather than mounted. It requires a command
to be run constantly, to watch synced files for changes and copy them to the guest, and
this proved to be a problem; as <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/3249">issues raised</a>
by others attest, the approach wasn&rsquo;t scaling to large (20k+ files) codebases, which
is common in my experience. I tried excluding some folders to see if that would help,
but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So after all that I ended up using the NFS sync option, which aside from requiring
a password for sudo when booting the VM has proved trouble free, so far. Performance
is good, both in terms of the applications themselves, and when browsing and modifying files
in the share; I&rsquo;ve seen PHPStorm occasionally lock up but then it always has ;) It&rsquo;s
certainly good enough to work with now, and I&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on the rsync and Parallels
options as they should improve in time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last 7 years I consider myself lucky to have been employed by Box UK. When I joined in 2007 I&rsquo;d spent the previous 3 years writing what I consider &lsquo;despite software&rsquo;. Software that did its job despite the efforts of the developer behind it. I was guilty of pretty much every bad practice at some stage; a direct result of me being the sole developer within both my company and my social circles. I didn&rsquo;t know better and had no-one to tell me otherwise, but by 2007 I knew I needed to address that by working for a company in which there were lots of people smarter and more experienced than me. To &ldquo;aim to be the dumbest person in the room&rdquo;, as it&rsquo;s often put - and never better than by my colleague and mentor at Box UK, <a href="http://twitter.com/handybitesize">Carey Hiles</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/37279704">speaking about being a lone coder</a> in the first <a href="http://unifieddiff.co.uk">Unified Diff</a> meetup put on several years later.</p>

<p>My first assignment at Box UK was making some tweaks to a web form on <a href="http://www.prometheanworld.com/gb/english/education/home/">Promethean&rsquo;s</a> e-commerce site. My last assignment was rearchitecting the technology behind <a href="http://www.careerswales.com">careerswales.com</a>, a multi-application portal serving millions of users, which is destined to help shape lives of the people of Wales for years to come. In between I&rsquo;ve created mobile applications, written web services, ported databases, implemented designs, discovered search platforms, pushed to queues, knocked out specifications, made many a calculation and finally - finally - got to grips with git. I&rsquo;ve taught schoolchildren how to code. I&rsquo;ve also shared more in-jokes than you could shake a stick at. Seriously.</p>

<p>As a software developer, I can&rsquo;t think of a better place to learn one&rsquo;s trade; every couple of months a new project comes along which will either improve existing skills, or demand new ones. Through the work that I&rsquo;ve done there I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to travel the world, meet heroes, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2f_BzKrpaU&amp;list=PLo7mBDsRHu11HSkEucxDIAxeBZUJp10Jn&amp;index=5">speak at conferences</a>. My colleagues have been everything I&rsquo;d hoped they&rsquo;d be - smart, friendly, and more than happy to help. Most importantly, they&rsquo;re passionate. Box UK have aimed to only hire those who care about the work they do, and that&rsquo;s clearly reflected in what we&rsquo;ve achieved.</p>

<p>TL/DR: I&rsquo;ve had an amazing job these last 7 years, and have loved every single minute of it.</p>

<p>After seven years I&rsquo;m ready for a new challenge, and a wonderful opportunity at a startup called <a href="http://bipsync.com">BipSync</a> means it&rsquo;s time to move on. I&rsquo;ll be working with some former colleagues on some exciting software in a domain that&rsquo;s fresh and interesting. I can&rsquo;t wait to get stuck in, and hopefully share my experiences. I&rsquo;d like to thank all at Box UK, especially Benno and those with whom I worked closely with over the years, for all the opportunities I was given and the experiences I&rsquo;ve had. You&rsquo;ve undoubtedly made me a better person, and I wish you all the best for the future.</p>

<p>I recently got a new Macbook (running Mavericks) and wanted to transfer the iMovie projects from my older machine (running Mountain Lion). The new machine featured the most recent version of iMovie (iMovie for Mac, version 10.0.2) while my old one was on 9.0.9.</p>

<p>I loaded the projects into iMovie for Mac by copying over the <code>iMovie Events</code>, <code>iMovie Original Movies</code> and <code>iMovie Projects</code> folders via AirDrop. Upon starting iMovie for Mac it prompted me to upgrade my projects to the new format. After some time a dialog appeared notifying me that some events had not been found, and that the upgrade had not been successful.</p>

<p>It turned out that the movie events were fine, but the background audio I&rsquo;d added (via iTunes) was missing because I&rsquo;d not copied over my iTunes folder (and hadn&rsquo;t planned to, since I now use iTunes in the Cloud). Attempting to open a ported project gave me a dialog along the lines of &lsquo;Upgrade now, with missing events, or upgrade later&rsquo; - the choice was inconsequential since even by choosing &lsquo;Upgrade later&rsquo; before putting the tracks in the places they were expected before opening the movie, the movie didn&rsquo;t seem to pick up on the fact that they were now there. The waveforms remained blank, and the audio didn&rsquo;t play. Of course, in most cases I didn&rsquo;t even know which files were missing because most of these movies were put together months ago.</p>

<p>I eventually fixed it by painstakingly downloading and importing each audio track into the movie alongside the original clip, which triggered a reload of the original. Then the second clip could be removed, leaving the original which now played. It would be nice if iMovie for Mac had a &lsquo;reload all events in this movie&rsquo; feature (perhaps it does, and I couldn&rsquo;t find it - I&rsquo;ve never found iMovie to have the most intuitive of interfaces)- thankfully I only had 20 or so tracks to fix, but for some more hardcore users it could be a lot worse.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve never really taken the time to read up on how DNS works. Ten years of web development mean I&rsquo;ve gradually assumed a pretty good idea through trial and error, but I&rsquo;ve never really felt 100% confident that I know what I&rsquo;m doing when registering and administering domain names, particularly when it comes to more obscure record types like <a href="http://www.zytrax.com/books/dns/ch9/spf.html">SPF</a>. Things work, but I don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> know why.</p>

<p>I was shopping for a domain name the other day and while on the DNSimple website I was invited to receive a series of emails that offered to outline the DNS basics. I batted away my initial reluctance to sign myself up for spam, and I&rsquo;m glad I did - the lessons are nicely written, short and to the point, and thankfully aren&rsquo;t just an excercise in advertising for the registrar. I&rsquo;ve learned a couple things and reinforced my knowledge of others. I can&rsquo;t find a signup link now, but I do recommend them to anyone who wants to learn more about DNS.</p>
